# Level 2 - Uplifted Mid-Level

Intermediate Python projects with advanced concepts and algorithms.

## Projects

1. **tictactoe_ai** – Tic Tac Toe vs minimax AI (alpha–beta)
2. **expense_tracker** – CSV-based expense tracker and monthly reports
3. **file_organizer** – Organize files by type; JSON config; --dry-run
4. **md_notes** – Markdown notes manager with basic HTML renderer
5. **quiz_game** – Multiple-choice quiz with JSON questions and highscores

## How to Run

From the repository root:

- Windows PowerShell: `python .\\level2\\<project_folder>\\main.py`
- macOS/Linux: `python3 ./level2/<project_folder>/main.py`

## Learning Focus

- File I/O and data persistence (CSV, JSON)
- Algorithm implementation (minimax, parsing)
- Configuration management
- Error handling and validation
- Data processing and analysis

## Prerequisites

Complete Level 1 projects first, or have equivalent Python experience.

## Next Steps

After Level 2, explore the `../dsa/` track for data structures and algorithms!
