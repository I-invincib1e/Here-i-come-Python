- **Two Pointers**: Efficient array traversal and comparison
- **Sliding Window**: Subarray problems with optimal substructure
- **Greedy Algorithms**: Locally optimal choices for global solutions

## üõ£Ô∏è Structured Learning Path

### Phase 1: Foundations (Arrays & Strings)
Start here if you're new to algorithms. Focus on basic manipulation and simple patterns.

1. **Arrays**: Two pointers, frequency counting, Kadane's algorithm
2. **Strings**: Anagrams, palindromes, character frequency analysis

### Phase 2: Data Structures (Hash Maps & Stacks)
Learn efficient data structures and their algorithmic applications.

3. **Hash Maps**: Grouping problems, prefix sums, collision handling
4. **Stacks & Queues**: Monotonic stacks, sliding windows, expression parsing

### Phase 3: Advanced Techniques (Recursion)
Master recursive thinking and complex problem-solving patterns.

5. **Recursion**: Backtracking, memoization, tree/graph traversals

## üöÄ How to Learn Effectively

### Study Approach
1. **Read Concepts**: Start with `LEARNING_GUIDE.md` for theoretical foundations
2. **Implement Solutions**: Work through `problems/` files systematically
3. **Run Tests**: Verify your solutions with `python -m pytest dsa/tests/`
4. **Analyze Efficiency**: Study time/space complexity and optimization techniques
5. **Practice Variations**: Modify problems and solve edge cases

### Best Practices
- **Understand Before Coding**: Think through the problem before writing code
- **Focus on Patterns**: Recognize similar problems and reusable techniques
- **Write Clean Code**: Use descriptive names, add comments, follow conventions
- **Test Thoroughly**: Consider edge cases, empty inputs, and boundary conditions
- **Review Solutions**: Compare your approach with optimal solutions

## üß™ Testing Your Knowledge

```bash
# Run all DSA tests
python -m pytest dsa/tests/

# Run specific topic tests
python -m pytest dsa/tests/test_arrays.py -v

# Run with coverage report
python -m pytest dsa/tests/ --cov=dsa.problems --cov-report=html
```

## üìà Skill Progression

- **Beginner**: Implement basic algorithms, understand time complexity
- **Intermediate**: Recognize patterns, optimize for efficiency
- **Advanced**: Create novel solutions, analyze trade-offs deeply

Each topic includes difficulty ratings, learning objectives, and implementation hints to guide your progress from basic understanding to advanced mastery.
