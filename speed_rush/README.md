# Python Speed Rush (7 Days)

A fast-paced, week-long plan to build consistency.

## Plan

- Day 1: Basics – variables, input, loops (edit `guess_number`).
- Day 2: Functions – refactor `calculator_cli` to use pure functions.
- Day 3: Files – add export/import to `todo_cli`.
- Day 4: Algorithms – implement `two_sum` and `max_subarray` in DSA.
- Day 5: CLI polish – help text, errors, and prompts.
- Day 6: Tests – add tests for at least 2 pure functions.
- Day 7: Share – open a PR with your improvements.
