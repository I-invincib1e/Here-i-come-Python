A comprehensive collection of hands-on Python projects designed for beginners to learn by building. This repository offers progressive difficulty from simple CLI tools to intermediate applications, plus a complete Data Structures & Algorithms track.

## 🎯 What You'll Find Here

### 📚 **Two Learning Tracks**

**Level 1: Simple Starters** (5 projects)
Perfect for absolute beginners - build confidence with basic CLI applications.

**Level 2: Uplifted Mid-Level** (5 projects)
Take your skills further with file I/O, data persistence, and simple algorithms.

### 🧠 **DSA Track**
Complete data structures and algorithms practice with:
- Arrays, Strings, Hash Maps, Stacks & Queues, Recursion
- Comprehensive test coverage (96 tests)
- Detailed explanations and time/space complexity analysis
- Real-world problem patterns

### 🧪 **Professional Quality**
- **125 tests** ensuring code reliability
- **Automated documentation** with MkDocs
- **Contributor-friendly** with clear issues and guides
- **Modern tooling** (pytest, ruff, mypy)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
