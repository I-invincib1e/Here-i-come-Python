# Python Practice Projects

Learn Python by building small, runnable programs. Start simple and level up.

## Quick Start

- Install Python 3.8+ and Git
- Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/I-invincib1e/Here-i-come-Python.git
cd Here-i-come-Python
```

- Run a project

```bash
python basic_programs/calculator_cli/main.py
```

## What’s Inside

- Basic programs: small CLIs (calculator, todo, stopwatch, etc.)
- Exercises: short practice problems
- Games: text and simple GUI/web games
- DSA: arrays, strings, hash maps, stacks/queues, recursion

## Where to Start

1. Read `README.md`
2. Try a Level 1 project in `basic_programs/`
3. Follow `dsa/LEARNING_GUIDE.md` if you want algorithms
