## üöÄ How to Practice Effectively

### Study Approach
1. **Read the Problem**: Understand requirements and constraints
2. **Plan Your Solution**: Think through the algorithm before coding
3. **Implement**: Write clean, readable code with comments
4. **Test**: Run the code and verify with different inputs
5. **Optimize**: Consider efficiency and alternative approaches

### Learning Tips
- **Start Simple**: Begin with exercises that match your current skill level
- **Focus on Concepts**: Understand why certain approaches work
- **Practice Variations**: Modify problems to test your understanding
- **Review Solutions**: Compare your approach with optimal solutions
- **Build Incrementally**: Use simpler exercises as building blocks

## üß™ Testing & Verification

### Individual Exercise Testing
```bash
# Run a specific exercise
python exercise1.py

# Run its test file
python tests/test_exercise1.py
```

### Interactive Learning
```bash
# Use the menu system
python main.py
```

### Comprehensive Testing
```bash
# Run all tests (if pytest is installed)
pytest tests/

# Or run individual test files
python tests/test_exercise1.py
python tests/test_exercise2.py
# ... etc
```
