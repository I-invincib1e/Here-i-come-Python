## How to Run

### Option 1: Run Individual Exercises
To run any exercise, navigate to this folder and execute the Python file:

```bash
python exercise1.py
```

Each file includes test cases that will print the expected output.

### Option 2: Use the Interactive Runner
For an interactive experience, use the main runner:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will present a menu to select and run any exercise.

### Option 3: Run Tests
To run the unit tests for all exercises:

```bash
cd tests
python test_exercise1.py
python test_exercise2.py
# ... and so on
```

Or use pytest if installed:

```bash
pytest tests/
```
