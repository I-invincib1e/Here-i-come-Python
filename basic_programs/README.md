# Basic Programs: Python Fundamentals

**Build your Python foundation** through hands-on projects that teach core programming concepts. Each project focuses on specific skills and gradually increases in complexity.

## üéØ Learning Path

Start with simple programs and progress to more complex ones. Each project builds on previous concepts while introducing new skills.

### Beginner Level (Projects 1-3)
Perfect for complete beginners learning basic syntax and logic.

1. **guess_number** ‚≠ê ‚Äì Number guessing game (loops, conditionals, random)
2. **calculator_cli** ‚≠ê ‚Äì REPL calculator (functions, error handling, math)
3. **todo_cli** ‚≠ê ‚Äì Task manager (data persistence, CRUD operations)

### Intermediate Level (Projects 4-7)
Introduces game logic, file operations, and data structures.

4. **stopwatch_cli** ‚≠ê‚≠ê ‚Äì Timing application (time module, user interaction)
5. **rock_paper_scissors** ‚≠ê‚≠ê ‚Äì Game with AI (random choices, game logic)
6. **tictactoe_ai** ‚≠ê‚≠ê ‚Äì Board game (2D arrays, minimax algorithm basics)
7. **expense_tracker** ‚≠ê‚≠ê ‚Äì Data management (CSV files, data analysis)

### Advanced Level (Projects 8-10)
Complex applications with multiple features and real-world patterns.

8. **file_organizer** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê ‚Äì File system utility (path operations, OS integration)
9. **md_notes** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê ‚Äì Content management (file parsing, search functionality)
10. **quiz_game** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê ‚Äì Interactive application (JSON data, scoring systems)

## üöÄ How to Run

From the repository root:

- Windows: `python .\\basic_programs\\<project>\\main.py`
- macOS/Linux: `python3 ./basic_programs/<project>/main.py`

## üìö Key Learning Objectives

### Programming Fundamentals
- **Variables & Data Types**: Strings, numbers, booleans, lists, dictionaries
- **Control Flow**: if/else statements, loops (for/while), break/continue
- **Functions**: Defining, calling, parameters, return values
- **Error Handling**: Try/except blocks, input validation

### Python Standard Library
- **Built-in Functions**: print(), input(), len(), range(), enumerate()
- **Math Operations**: Basic arithmetic, random number generation
- **String Manipulation**: Formatting, parsing, case conversion
- **File I/O**: Reading/writing text files, CSV handling

### Problem-Solving Skills
- **Algorithm Design**: Step-by-step problem breakdown
- **Data Structures**: Choosing appropriate containers for data
- **User Experience**: Input validation, clear output formatting
- **Code Organization**: Modular design, readable variable names

### Best Practices
- **PEP 8 Style**: Consistent formatting and naming conventions
- **Documentation**: Docstrings, comments, clear code structure
- **Testing**: Manual testing, edge case consideration
- **Error Messages**: Helpful user feedback and debugging

## üéÆ Project Categories

- **Games**: Interactive entertainment with scoring and user feedback
- **Utilities**: Practical tools for everyday tasks
- **Data Management**: File handling and information organization
- **CLI Applications**: Command-line interfaces with user interaction

Each project includes a detailed README with learning objectives, implementation hints, and extension ideas for further practice.
