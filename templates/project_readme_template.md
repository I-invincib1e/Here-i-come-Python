## How It Works

- Problem the program solves
- Key concepts used (e.g., parsing, file I/O, data structures)
- Data flow (input → processing → output)
- Important functions and their roles
- Edge cases and error handling

## Example

Show a small input and the expected output or interaction transcript.

```text
> sample interaction or example data
```

## Internals

- File layout and important modules
- Algorithms/logic in bullet points
