# Project Overview

This repository is a curated set of hands-on Python projects for beginners to practice by building. It also includes:

- DSA Track: small, focused problems with stubs and tests.
- Python Speed Rush: a 7-day practice plan.
- Guides: setup, learning path, contribution tips.

## Goals

- Provide clear, runnable examples using only the standard library.
- Offer progressive difficulty from basics to mid-level.
- Encourage contributions via small, well-scoped tasks.

## Structure

- Level 1 Projects: quick wins to build confidence.
- Level 2 Projects: deeper practice with files, parsing, and simple algorithms.
- DSA: functions-first problems designed for TDD and repetition.
- Speed Rush: daily challenges to build consistency.
