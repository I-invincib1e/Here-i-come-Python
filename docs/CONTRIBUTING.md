Thanks for helping improve this learning repository! Please keep it beginner-friendly.

## Getting Started

- Use Python 3.8+.
- Prefer the standard library; avoid external deps unless essential for learning.
- Run examples in each project's README.

## Style

- Write clear, readable code with descriptive names.
- Add type hints for public functions.
- Keep functions small and focused; avoid deep nesting.
- Include a short README section for any new project.

## Adding a New Project

1. Create a folder with `main.py` and `README.md`.
2. Keep it runnable with `python ./<project>/main.py`.
3. Include minimal data files if needed (e.g., `questions.json`).
4. Update the top-level README project list.

## Issues and PRs

- Open an issue describing the idea/fix first (optional but helpful).
- In PRs, show before/after if changing behavior.
- Keep changes small and scoped.
